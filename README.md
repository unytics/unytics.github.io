### Hi there 👋, I am [Paul](https://www.linkedin.com/in/paul-marcombes/)

### an *Open-Source Data-Products* builder 🚀.

***From Head of Data to Open-Source Data-Products builder***

As Head of Data at Nickel, I scaled data-organization from 3 to 100+ data-practitioners. 

My vision is to give data-power to data-analysts by making them autonomous on the whole data-chain: from data-collection to data-algorithm-deployments 👉 *we build data products for that*. 

I created **Unytics** to go further as a personal project 👉 *provide open-source data products to the worldwide data-community.*

***Products built so far:***

- ⚡ **[bigfunctions](https://github.com/unytics/bigfunctions)**: *Supercharge BigQuery with open-source curated functions.*
- ⚡ **[simple_airbyte](https://github.com/unytics/simple_airbyte)**: *Simplify Airbyte Management via a lightweigth CLI (no UI, no kubernetes cluster to manage, no database)*
