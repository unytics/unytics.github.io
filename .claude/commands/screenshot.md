description: Copy the most recent screenshot from Windows Screenshots folder to assets/, optionally renaming it
---

Copy the most recent screenshot from `/mnt/c/Users/conta/Pictures/Screenshots/` to the `assets/` folder.

If I provide a filename (without extension), rename it to that name with .png extension.
If I don't provide a filename, keep the original name.

After copying, show me what was copied and the final filename.
