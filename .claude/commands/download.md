description: Copy the most recent file from Windows Downloads folder to assets/, optionally renaming it
---

Copy the most recent file from `/mnt/c/Users/conta/Downloads/` to the `assets/` folder.

If I provide a filename (with or without extension), rename it to that name. If no extension is provided, keep the original extension.
If I don't provide a filename, keep the original name.

After copying, show me what was copied and the final filename.
